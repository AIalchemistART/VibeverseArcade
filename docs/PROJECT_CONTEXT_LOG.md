## üåü Project Overview
AI Alchemist's Lair is an interactive portfolio experience with a medieval-cyberpunk aesthetic. Players explore as a wizard avatar, discovering portfolio content and accessing a community hub for other game designers.

### Core Concept
- **Theme**: Medieval-cyberpunk fusion
- **Perspective**: First-person exploration with isometric rendering
- **Primary Purpose**: Interactive portfolio and community hub

### Key Features
- **Left-Click Interaction**: Primary general interaction method
- **Right-Click Projectile**: Cast magical projectiles for puzzles and interactions
- **Grand Ballroom Portal Room**: Access hub for other designers' games
- **Dynamic Lighting & Effects**: Reactive environment with cyberpunk aesthetics

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Structure
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Rendering**: Canvas API with isometric projection
- **Architecture**: Modular ES6 JavaScript with separate files for different concerns
- **Asset Management**: Custom asset loading system (planned)

## üìä Current Progress Status
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Environment & Core Interaction Foundation
- **Completed Steps**:
  - ‚úÖ Step 1: Basic Project Structure (index.html, styles.css, main.js)
  - ‚úÖ Step 2: Canvas Initialization
  - ‚úÖ Step 3: Input Handling Module (keyboard/mouse tracking)

- **Currently Implementing**:
  - üîÑ Step 4: Import Input Module in main.js

- **Upcoming Steps**:
  - ‚è≥ Step 5: Test Scene Module
  - ‚è≥ Step 6: Game Loop Implementation
  - ‚è≥ Step 7: Canvas Styling and Presentation
  - ‚è≥ Step 8: Asset Loading Foundation
  - ‚è≥ Step 9: Testing and Validation

## üó∫Ô∏è Development Roadmap Overview
The project follows a 10-phase development approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Environment & Core Interaction Foundation *(current phase)*
2. **Phase 2**: Camera Systems & Controls
3. **Phase 3**: Physics / Movement / Collision Systems
4. **Phase 4**: Procedural Generation / Scene Composition Logic
5. **Phase 5**: Character Models / Animations / Dynamic Interactions
6. **Phase 6**: UI Systems, Portfolio Integration, Core Logic Loops
7. **Phase 7**: Aesthetic Layer (Lighting, Post-Processing, Theming)
8. **Phase 8**: Audio Systems (Music, SFX, Feedback Loops)
9. **Phase 9**: Optimization Pass
10. **Phase 10**: Final Polish

## üîç Project Rules & Guidelines
- **Prevent Core File Bloating**: Move new features to dedicated submodules
- **Module Dependencies**: Keep interdependencies minimal and explicit
- **Plugin Architecture**: Design for extensibility
- **Documentation**: Maintain JSDoc comments and update PROGRESS_LOG.md
- **Input System**: Expand through input module's registration system
- **Event System**: Use event-based communication between modules

## üö© Potential Pitfalls & Previous Issues
- Avoid file management system issues that caused the project restart
- Maintain modular code structure to prevent monolithic files
- Follow the implementation steps in PROGRESS_LOG.md to avoid repeating errors

## üéØ Current Implementation Goals
1. **Complete Phase 1**: Finish all steps in the Phase 1 roadmap to establish core functionality
2. **Left-Click Interaction**: Implement as primary interaction method
3. **Right-Click Projectile**: Create magical projectile mechanic
4. **Grand Ballroom Portal System**: Design foundation for the community hub
