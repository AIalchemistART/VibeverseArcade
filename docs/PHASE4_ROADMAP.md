# Phase 4: Scene Composition and Environment Design

## Overview
Phase 4 focuses on creating a robust scene composition and environment design system for the AI Alchemist's Lair. This phase will implement a modular scene structure, scene transitions, interactive objects, and asset management.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Scene Data Structure
- Create `sceneData.js` to define a structure for handcrafted environments
- Implement basic scenes with defined exits and objects
- Establish a foundation for scene-specific properties

### 2. Create Scene Manager Module  
- Implement `sceneManager.js` with scene loading and management functionality
- Create methods to access and transition between scenes
- Establish core scene management logic

### 3. Integrate Scene Manager into Game Loop
- Import and initialize the SceneManager in the main game loop
- Set up the initial scene loading process
- Integrate scene rendering into the update cycle

### 4. Create Scene Rendering Logic
- Develop `sceneRenderer.js` to handle scene visualization
- Implement basic scene rendering methods
- Connect renderer to the main game loop

### 5. Add Interactive Objects
- Create `interactiveObjects.js` to define interactive elements
- Implement base interaction functionality
- Update scene data to use interactive object instances

### 6. Implement Scene Transitions
- Add logic to handle scene transitions via exits
- Create input handling for scene navigation
- Enable directional movement between scenes

### 7. Add Object Interaction Logic
- Implement interaction handling in the renderer
- Add click detection for interactive objects
- Connect user input to object interaction events

### 8. Optimize Asset Loading for Scenes
- Create `assetLoader.js` for asset preloading
- Implement scene-specific asset management
- Integrate the loader with scene transitions

### 9. Add Scene-Specific Logic
- Enhance scene data with custom logic and events
- Implement onEnter and onExit scene events
- Create a framework for scene-specific behaviors

### 10. Test Scene Transitions and Interactions
- Implement verification tests for scene functionality
- Test scene navigation and object interactions
- Ensure smooth operation of the scene system

## Design Principles
- **Modularity:** Split code across multiple files to maintain clarity
- **Scalability:** Use ES6 imports and modular structure for easy expansion
- **Efficiency:** Implement asset preloading and lightweight scene data
- **Clarity:** Keep each component focused on a specific responsibility

## Technical Notes
- All JavaScript files use ES6 module syntax
- Maintain separation of concerns across all modules
- Keep core files like `main.js` and `game.js` lean by offloading functionality
- Ensure HTML file loads main.js as a module
