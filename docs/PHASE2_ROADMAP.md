# Phase 2 Roadmap: Camera Systems & Controls

## Overview

With the successful completion of Phase 1 (Environment & Core Interaction Foundation), we now have a solid base to build upon for Phase 2: Camera Systems & Controls. This phase will focus on implementing a robust camera system that enhances the medieval-cyberpunk themed gameplay experience while maintaining the modular architecture established in Phase 1.

## Objectives

1. Create a camera system that follows the player character
2. Implement camera movement controls (panning, zooming)
3. Add collision boundaries and edge indicators
4. Create smooth camera transitions and effects
5. Implement navigation aids (mini-map, compass)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Camera Module Creation
- Create a new `camera.js` file with a `Camera` class
- Define properties for position, dimensions, and zoom
- Implement methods for positioning and following the player
- Add boundary logic to prevent camera from showing outside the map

### 2. Scene Integration
- Update `scene.js` to accept camera parameters for rendering
- Modify rendering logic to offset based on camera position
- Implement render culling (only draw what's visible in camera view)
- Ensure proper scaling based on camera zoom level

### 3. Camera Controls
- Add keyboard controls for manual camera movement
- Implement mouse-based camera panning (middle-click drag)
- Add mouse wheel zoom functionality
- Create "snap to player" hotkey (C key)
- Add edge-of-screen panning when mouse is near borders

### 4. Boundary Visualization
- Create visual indicators when camera is near map boundaries
- Implement subtle overlay effects for edge detection
- Add collision feedback when player reaches map limits
- Ensure boundaries scale and position correctly with zoom

### 5. Camera Transitions
- Implement smooth camera movement using interpolation
- Add easing functions for more natural movement
- Create transition effects for zoom operations
- Add camera shake for future interaction feedback

### 6. Navigation Aids
- Create mini-map component showing player and camera position
- Implement compass or directional indicators
- Add visual markers for important points of interest
- Ensure navigation aids are toggleable for clean UI

### 7. Game Loop Integration
- Update main game loop to include camera updates
- Ensure camera movement is frame-rate independent using delta time
- Optimize camera-related calculations for performance
- Add appropriate debug logging for camera operations

### 8. Testing & Optimization
- Test camera system on varying map sizes
- Ensure smooth performance at different zoom levels
- Optimize rendering further based on camera view
- Add framerate monitoring for camera-intensive operations

## Technical Considerations

### Modular Architecture
- Keep `camera.js` focused solely on camera functionality
- Create separate modules for mini-map and other navigation aids
- Maintain clean separation between camera logic and rendering
- Avoid bloating main.js with camera-specific code

### Performance Optimization
- Implement view culling to only render visible elements
- Use efficient matrix operations for camera transformations
- Minimize calculations in the render loop
- Consider bitmap caching for static elements

### Compatibility
- Ensure camera works consistently across supported browsers
- Add fallbacks for browsers without wheel event support
- Maintain responsive design considerations with camera view

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 will be considered complete when:

1. Player can smoothly navigate the map using camera controls
2. Camera appropriately follows the player with smooth transitions
3. Map boundaries are visually indicated when approached
4. Navigation aids help orient the player in the game world
5. Camera system maintains high performance even on larger maps
6. All controls work intuitively and responsively
7. Code maintains the modular, clean architecture established in Phase 1

## Timeline Estimate

- Camera Module Creation: 1-2 days
- Scene Integration: 1-2 days
- Camera Controls: 2-3 days
- Boundary Visualization: 1-2 days
- Camera Transitions: 1-2 days
- Navigation Aids: 2-3 days
- Game Loop Integration: 1 day
- Testing & Optimization: 2-3 days

Total: 10-18 days (depending on complexity and refinement needs)
