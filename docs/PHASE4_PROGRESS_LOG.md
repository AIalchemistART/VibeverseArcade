  - Implemented `debugControls.js` for test activation
  - Added keyboard shortcut (L key) to run tests
  - Implemented URL parameter-based test triggering
  - Integrated testing into the main application without bloating main.js

- **Step 11: Define Basic Room Layouts** ‚úÖ
  - Updated `sceneData.js` with detailed room dimensions (width and height)
  - Added precise exit positions for scene transitions
  - Specified object positions for better scene composition
  - Enhanced the startRoom, portfolioRoom, and portfolioShowcase scenes
  - Maintained clean modular structure while extending scene data
  
- **Step 12: Integrate Scene Renderer** ‚úÖ
  - Updated `main.js` to import and initialize SceneRenderer
  - Added SceneRenderer to main render loop for persistent room visuals
  - Connected scene manager with renderer for seamless scene transitions
  - Implemented proper rendering of scene-specific visual elements
  - Maintained clean code organization by minimizing changes to main.js

- **Step 13: Implement Interactive Doorways** ‚úÖ
  - Created `portals.js` with Portal class for visualizing and interacting with doorways
  - Implemented `portalManager.js` to manage portals across scenes
  - Added animated portal visuals with direction-based coloring and icons
  - Implemented proximity-based collision detection for scene transitions
  - Integrated portal system with the main game loop while maintaining separation of concerns

- **Step 14: Enhance Room Visuals** ‚úÖ
  - Updated SceneRenderer with distinct room visual markers for better spatial awareness
  - Added scene-specific colored walls with accent lighting along edges
  - Implemented floor grid patterns for better depth perception
  - Enhanced the medieval-cyberpunk aesthetic with glowing wall edges
  - Maintained separation of rendering concerns in sceneRenderer.js

- **Step 15: Upgrade Floor and Wall Graphics** ‚úÖ
  - Implemented proper isometric 3D walls with cyberpunk-style glowing edges
  - Added asset loading system for game graphics with automatic preloading
  - Integrated custom floor tile image from assets/decor folder
  - Optimized tile rendering with overlap factor to create seamless floor
