# Phase 2 Completion: Camera Systems & Controls

## Core Features Implemented

### Camera Module
- Created comprehensive `camera.js` with position, dimensions, and zoom control
- Implemented smooth following behavior with interpolation
- Added zoom functionality with mouse wheel and bounds checking

### Input Improvements
- Enhanced keyboard input handling for smoother movement
- Added middle-mouse button panning for camera control
- Implemented 'C' key to center camera on player

### Rendering Optimization
- Only draw grid cells visible within the camera's view
- Significantly improved performance for larger grid sizes
- Added boundary indicators to show grid edges

### Navigation Aids
- Added edge indicators that appear when approaching grid boundaries
- Implemented visual feedback for environment navigation
- Enhanced HUD with player/camera coordinate display

## Technical Achievements

1. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Reduced draw calls by limiting to visible cells only
   - Calculate visible cell range based on camera zoom and position
   - Debug information showing visible vs. total cells

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Created `panState.js` to avoid circular dependencies
   - Enhanced organization through proper module separation
   - Clean interfaces between system components

3. **Improved Input System**
   - More consistent keyboard event handling
   - Better mouse event tracking 
   - Enhanced responsiveness for middle-mouse panning

## Performance Improvements

- Grid rendering is now optimized to only process visible cells
- Camera movement and zoom performance enhanced
- Fixed issues with mouse wheel zoom centering

## Next Steps for Phase 3

1. Implement better asset loading and management
2. Add interactive objects to the environment
3. Develop dialogue system for NPCs
4. Create inventory and collectible system
5. Enhance visual effects and animations
