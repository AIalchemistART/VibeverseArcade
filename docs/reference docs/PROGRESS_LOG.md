### Development Roadmap Update: Strategic Pivot
After reviewing the project's progress and goals, we've made a strategic decision to update our development roadmap for Phase 4 and beyond. The key change is moving from procedural generation to handcrafted, modular scenes to better showcase the portfolio content.

#### Updated Roadmap Overview:

**Phase 4: Scene Composition and Environment Design** *(Next Phase)*
- Objective: Create handcrafted, modular scenes forming the interactive portfolio's layout
- Key Deliverables:
  - Design predefined scenes (rooms, corridors) with intentional layouts for portfolio items
  - Implement scene transitions (doors, portals) for navigation between areas
  - Place interactive objects (buttons, switches, portfolio triggers) with placeholder functionality
- Development Approach:
  - Modular scene structure for easy editing and component reuse
  - Preloading of critical assets for smooth transitions
  - Optimization of scene data for performance

**Phase 5: Character Models / Animations / Dynamic Interactions**
- Add player avatar with basic animations (walking, idle)
- Implement NPC interactions and dialogue triggers
- Optional avatar customization features

**Phase 6: UI Systems, Scoring/Tracking, Core Logic Loops**
- Create UI components (menus, info panels) using HTML/CSS
- Implement main game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- Add progress tracking systems

**Phase 7: Aesthetic Layer (Lighting, Post-Processing, Theming)**
- Add lighting effects via CSS or shaders
- Implement post-processing effects for enhanced visuals
- Apply consistent thematic elements across all assets

**Phase 8: Audio Systems (Music, SFX, Feedback Loops)**
- Add background music and ambiance
- Implement sound effects for interactions
- Ensure audio provides feedback for user actions

**Phase 9: Optimization Pass**
- Compress assets and minify code
- Implement scene-specific lazy loading
- Profile and optimize rendering loops

**Phase 10: Final Polish**
- Add smooth transitions between scenes
- Implement polished menus and UI elements
- Include robust error handling
- Enhance accessibility features

#### Impact of Changes:
This pivot from procedural to handcrafted scenes provides several benefits:
1. Better control over the user experience and portfolio presentation
2. More intentional design of interactions and navigation
3. Simplified asset management with predefined scenes
4. Enhanced ability to tailor each area to specific portfolio content
5. More predictable performance characteristics

The core principles of modular design, performance focus, and quality user experience remain unchanged, while the implementation approach shifts to prioritize handcrafted quality over procedural quantity.

## Current Status
- Phase 1 of 10 completed (100% complete)
- Phase 2 of 10 completed (100% complete)
- Phase 3 of 10 completed (100% complete)
- Preparing to begin Phase 4 with updated approach
