# ðŸ§ª AI Alchemist's Lair - Technical Development Roadmap ðŸ§ª

## Development Philosophy
This roadmap follows a "vibe coding" methodology, emphasizing small, controlled iterations that build upon each other like layers in a painting. Each phase is designed to be modular, testable, and focused on specific technical aspects of the project. This approach helps manage complexity, minimize bugs, and maintain creative flexibility throughout development.
