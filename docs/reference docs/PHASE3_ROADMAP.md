# Phase 3: Physics / Movement / Collision Systems

## Project Overview
This phase focuses on implementing core physics, movement, and collision detection systems for the AI Alchemist's Lair. These systems will provide the foundation for interactive gameplay mechanics.

## Implementation Roadmap

### 1. Physics Module
- Create `physics.js` with basic gravity and physics properties
- Implement gravity application to entities

### 2. Entity Base Class
- Create `entity.js` with base Entity class
- Implement position, velocity, and update methods

### 3. Player Entity Extension
- Extend Player from Entity class
- Add player-specific movement methods

### 4. Collision Detection
- Create `collision.js` with AABB collision detection
- Implement basic entity-entity collision checking

### 5. Physics & Collision Integration
- Integrate physics and collision into game loop
- Apply gravity and check collisions in update cycle

### 6. Ground Collision
- Implement ground collision detection 
- Prevent entities from falling through floor
- Add isGrounded state tracking

### 7. Jumping Mechanics
- Create `player.js` with jumping functionality
- Implement jump input handling

### 8. Collision Response
- Add collision response handling
- Implement entity movement resolution on collision

### 9. Optimized Collision
- Create spatial partitioning grid for efficient collision detection
- Implement entity proximity checks

### 10. Debug Visualization
- Create debugging tools for collision visualization
- Implement toggleable debug mode

## Technical Architecture
- Modular ES6 architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Core systems in separate files to prevent bloating main.js
- Direct dependencies between components minimized
