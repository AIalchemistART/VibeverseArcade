# Placeholder Assets

The following placeholder assets should be created or sourced for the game:

## Door Tiles
- Door Tile NE.png - Northeast facing door for north walls
- Door Tile NW.png - Northwest facing door for west walls

These should match the medieval-cyberpunk aesthetic with a similar style to the wall tiles but with a visible doorway opening.
